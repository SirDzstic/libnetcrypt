ABSTRACT

Do not use this library in your uranium enrichment facility.

TL;DR

I am not an expert in cryptology. This project was started to make adding
cryptography to another network-capable project easy and to be reused in
future projects. I did my best to avoid any weaknesses I could find information
about and documented why I did certain things the way I did in the source code.
In the end, this means nothing. It could be terribly broken. Don't rely on this
library to keep anything secure from any serious attacker. Now get OpenSSL or
something.

If you find any flaws in the implementation of any of the cryptographic algo-
rithms, please tell me. I will fix them.
